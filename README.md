# University of Michigan Astro 461 -- Python Cookbook

Hello, and welcome to Astro 461! I've created this repository to serve as a tutorial about some useful tools for astronomy analysis in Python for those of you who have not used Python extensively thus far. I hope it proves to be helpful!

## Installation

To start using the code in this repository, use your terminal to navigate to the directory you'd like all of your Astro 461 work to be in. Then type

```bash
git clone https://sjhamilton820@bitbucket.org/sjhamilton820/astro-461-python-cookbook.git
```

## Usage

You should see a number of iPython(Jupyter) notebooks in this new directory, in addition to a subdirectory called `Sampledata`. The notebooks make use of the FITS files located within `Sampledata`, which were taking using instruments you'll be using later in this class!
